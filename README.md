My first project that I've dedicated time to. I am using it to apply skills and techniques that I learn to a project that I am personally vested in.

Allows for the encryption/decryption of a message (currently only consisting of the 100 primary printable ascii characters) using a seed based system.
The user sends an encoded message that can only be deciphered with the correct key/seed.
